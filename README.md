![Unit Tests](https://github.com/govindchari/QPSolver/actions/workflows/unit_tests.yml/badge.svg)


A C++ solver for quadratic programs that utilizes Mehrotra's predictor-corrector algorithm.

Based on cvxgen paper includes
  - -O3 compiler optimiation
  - Permuted LDLT decomposition
  - Iterative refinement (eventually)
  - Sparse matrices (eventually)
